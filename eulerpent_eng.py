  NOTE: The video lecture by Dr. Burkard Polster on his YouTube channel, Mathologer, was instrumental in inspiring this algorithm. 
  The implementation below is intended to demonstrate what he referred to as the "Euler-chain-engine," rather than simply solving 
  the problem using Pentagonal Numbers or related concepts.
  
  I would also like to emphasize that, while Dr. Burkard's explanations and animations make the algorithm easy to understand, 
  coders are encouraged to pay close attention to the memory consumption of their machines when implementing this solution.

Thanks,  
Darshan P.
